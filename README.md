# Developer Notes

## How to create static templates

1. Add template definition json file in assets/templates
2. Register the template definition file in assets/templates/_template-index.json

### Rules and how to instantiate templates

- Rules need a RuleCreator impl.
- Rules need a RulesArg definition
- RuleCreators must be registered in app.module.ts (for injection)

## Common Issues

Run in Terminal: `export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider`
